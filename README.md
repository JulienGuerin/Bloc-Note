# blocnote

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I made this App for personal use, but I also published it on PlayStore for those who may need it. You can find my App here :

With this App, you can write anything you want, this is just for you because everything is saved in your phone memory and not in an online database.

When you scroll down and up that's make appear and disapear the floating button.

You can quickly and easily access the content of a note using the arrow on the right side of the note.

And finally, you can organize your notes and tasks by priority.
